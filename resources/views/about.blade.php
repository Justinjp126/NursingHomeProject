                students
                in

                and personal care facilities in need of supplies, and save lives.</>

                hard by COVID-19. In Pennsylvania alone, over half of deaths from COVID-19 have been residents of
                nursing homes and personal care homes. At the same time, many of these facilities lack adequate
                protective equipment such as masks for staff and residents, compounding the problem. <span><a
